        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to assist a local politician with gathering the information they need to know right after a mass shooting has occurred - which, unfortunately, is not an unusual event in the United States.</p>
        
        <p>In order to practice on a live event, this website displays information that is relevant for the shooting that occurred on January 4th in Perry, IA, at a middle school. The aim is to provide a local politician (for instance, Republican Governer Kim Reynolds) with the key information they would need in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communicate in near-real time (Twitter, interviews, press conferencesâ€¦)</li>
            <li>Think through medium-term policy implications.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The originality of our approach, beyond integrating the most up-to-date sources, is to scan through live content emerging on the web (X.com, Reddit, etc) to provide the freshest outlook on voter sentiment.</p>

        <h2>Learning goals for the developing team are:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment with and internalize the scrum process</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Data visualization</li>
                    <li>Consolidation and comparison of different sources</li>
