Reddit,"So, despite what you might know, there is nowhere in the US you can buy a gun without a background check. It's federal law. Maybe there are some loopholes, but if you have a record it's going to be known when your paperwork is being done. Additionally, if you buy two or more firearms at once, the ATF is going to get a form with your info. At this point, they may monitor your social media if they can find it. Not 100% on that and I don't really care what their policy is. There aren't enough 'local authorities' to actually keep up with that monitoring. Red flag laws supposedly work where they are in place, but it's a system that can be abused very easily and there are questions about violation of privacy, and unlawful search/seizures.",Gun control laws don't work,x
Reddit,"It sounds like you have been listening to CNN too much. We don't have a gun problem despite what you have heard. We have a mental health problem. Just based on FBI stats, a person is much more likely to be stabbed to death or beaten with a blunt object than a gun, any gun. Even then, 60% of all guns are suicide. All rifles make up 4% of guns deaths and what you call ""assault style"" rifles make up a percentage of those, mass shootings a percentage of those, and school shootings a percentage of those. The chance is 1 in millions.",This is because of mental health,
Reddit,"Fact: Every time you leave your house, you are roughly 100X more likely to be killed by a drunk driver than by a mass shooter. One. Hundred. Times. More. Likely. There are more than 10,000 killed by drunk drivers in the US every year — more than 27 a day, every, single, day. Mass shootings are virtually non-existent by comparison. So if you are going to lose sleep, lose sleep over drunk drivers. If you want to ban something and have it actually make a difference, ban alcohol.",,
Reddit,"Very complex issue. Unfortunately, even if all these things went right and worked, we'd still have mass shootings. Why is that? Million dollar question. Is it guns? I don't think so. Is it mental health? Maybe. The economy screwing people over? That happens, but then why harm so many others? Maybe it's a combination. Maybe there's an underground terror ring that wants us all disarmed... alright no tin foil hats lol.",We don't have enough data,x

NYT,"Health is the meta issue in school shootings and as usual America's physicians are given a pass for abdicating their responsibilities and abandoning their oaths to lead on this critical health issue. There are no physicians on the planet who violate their oaths more than ours and they hide behind the American Medical Association's priority to first ensure that ""the sacred private practice of medicine"" to enrich beyond all imagination those with an MD in this country will always take precedence over all. We Americans allow our nation's physicians to live in their insulated silos never leading on critical issues where society and health intersect. The woman in Ohio who being charged with a crime involving her spontaneous abortion is the greatest indictment of the cowardice of America's doctors. As a tribute to Sidney Wolfe who died just within a few days ago who feared nothing and no one whether in the greatest positions of power in the pharmaceutical industry or your local dentist who knew he could clean more deeply into your gums and save you from wanton visits to periodontists, we need to stop giving America's most powerful professional group a pass on performing their duties to be out in the streets, on the steps of every capital, organizing protests and leading--leading and teaching is the very definition of ""doctor"" from its ancient definition inLatin ""Docere"" to teach--accomplishing an end to these shootings, an end to an Ohio woman miscarrying because they are cowards.",,
NYT,"In reply to my own post and to add some context: Mea culpa. I own multiple firearms. A safe full of them in fact. I shoot shotguns, rifles, and handguns regularly, sometimes in competition, but often just for sport, and I haven't hunted in a while. I also have a concealed carry permit and regularly carry a handgun. I am most definitely not anti-gun in the sense of ""ban all guns"". But to deny that we need stricter gun regulation is absurd given the level of gun violence in our country. As we as a society can't seem to create in our citizens the need to behave responsibly and respect the lives of others, something does need to be done. That is probably along the lines of REQUIRING by law the licensing of owners, registering guns, training, safe storage, etc. And then very likely allowing stop and frisk searches to remove guns from those not in compliance. Yes, I can hear the cries of infringement and illegal search - but so be it. No right is absolute. Even the 2nd and 4th amendments. All rights are subject to due process. And something MUST be done. It's deplorable that the number one cause of child deaths in the US is firearms, and the daily reports of shootings over simple disagreements and slights. I'm willing to have some restrictions placed on my ownership rights, pay some small fees, and even jump through a few hoops to save the lives of my fellow citizens.

Now we have another shooting: 1 dead and ""5 others"" shot up and some will have injuries that will last the rest of their lives. The gun that shot them wasn't insured. There will be no one-off payment of a million dollars to that family, nor will any private insurer be picking up the bill for all the medical cost to come. This country refuses to have Universal Medical Care, so any person shot will fall through the cracks of the insurance companies CHOICES on what they will cover today.... and what they will be CHOOSING to cover next week. I want to know how many families have gone bankrupt because a member of the family was shot. Were they covered? For how long? How soon before the insurance company dumped them?

They retrieved the carcass and were home by noon, at which time my little cousin washed up and headed out to ballet class and her weekly flute lesson. Dad got started processing the carcass and their family had venison for months. In rural areas, guns are tools. Nearly every household has a shotgun or hunting rifle. Children are taught to use, maintain and respect them. They are absolutely NOT considered or treated as toys. There is a loud, persistent sector of our society that does treat guns as toys, objects of fantasy, required accessories for the rogue hero in a fictional dangerous world. This sector is led and fueled by the NRA. NRA used to be all about safe, responsible gun ownership. Now it exists to promote the gun industry. Thanks to Citizen's United, it does so with impunity and makes a small number of people obsecenely wealthy and powerful in the process.

NYT,"@Kimberly Some 50 years ago, in central NJ, which then was not the suburban edge-city sprawl it is today, a classmate, who was by modern definition a bully, ""called me out"" to the parking lot after school. In those days, it meant he wanted to fight me. I, out of some stupid notion of not being seen as a coward by others, showed up as requested. We went at it for a bit, fists flying, rolling on the ground, perhaps 5 minutes in all, with a good sized audience. I think we both had a few bruises, I had a black eye and he had a split lip. Now, we both happened to have shotguns in our cars, because it was duck season, and many of us hunted after school. But NO ONE would have ever thought, even for a moment, that shooting someone was an option. There was a code of sorts - a behavioral line NO ONE crossed. Weapons were not how MEN settled their disagreements. And we both went hunting (not together) near the same pond the next day. While we never became friends, we never fought again either. So no, I and many others of my generation never thought at that time that society would degrade to this level of baseline violence. Breakdown of nuclear families, saturation of violence on TV and video games and music, lack of discipline (and punishment), denser populations, etc., all play a part I believe.

If you live in such an area, be forewarned: the consequences of encouraging people of all situations of life to protect themselves, to make themselves more secure in a seemingly increasingly insecure world are coming to your corner of that world. These are the consequences of the Heller decision and of a gun culture allowed to argue without merit a nonsensical ""right"" for anyone and everyone to own and wield firearms. Nowhere in the 2nd Amendment should such a ""right"" have been found. For 200 years, the Supreme Court resisted any urges to discover it, because the language of this amendment was clear enuf: it was about personal security and not about individual rights. Militias are about protecting such security; unfettered gun ownership is obviously not. In fact, it produces the opposite of personal security, as all of us should have learned by now. Reversing Heller should be a primary goal of any reform of our legal system. Awareness of rampant gun ownership leading to illicit gun use should be as wide as the oceans.

I have worked in an office where an employee was fired and we had to have a police guard for weeks because he threatened retaliation. My manager had a carry permit and kept a gun in the office. I didn't find that out until after I was hired, after I was coached by the poice to watch who come into the open front door I sat in front of.

Fox News,"Indeed.  We had the county extension agent come to school to teach gun safety.  In high school lots of the boys and the teachers had guns so they could leave school and hunt during deer season.  No shootings.  If someone had a grudge, they'd meet after school and fist fight.",,
Fox News,This didn't happen when we had prayer in school to acknowledge the presence of God and parents took their kids to Church and Sunday school giving them the option to become a Christian. A Christian would never do this. Bet the parents never gave this shooter the option either. ,,

Fox News,"This is a broad societal problem, where we have a country full of broken young people. Blaming objects, suggesting a new law or sign, are  both cop-outs.
