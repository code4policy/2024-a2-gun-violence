Be tough on crime,If it’s so predictable how did you not predict it and stop it?
Be tough on crime,"If you see something, say something. If even one person who saw the shooter's social media posts had contacted law enforcement, this tragedy could have been averted. Nikki Haley responded to the shooting by saying that we had to do hard work on mental illness. The problem with this argument is that other Western nations have a fraction of the shootings that we do in the U.S. Rates of mental illness are the same in the U.S. as they are in those other nations. The difference? The easy availability of guns in the U.S. Our legislators need to enact universal background checks and Red Flag laws."
Be tough on crime,Is it guns? What else couuld it be? Guns dont shoot on their own....say it.
Be tough on crime,The gun did not do this the shooter did.
Be tough on crime,This is America. We don’t punish thought crimes. Get out of here commie
Be tough on crime,Will not stop until people stop blaming the tool of choice versus the act of a person. 
Democrats are the problem,"Already, one day later, this story is buried way down the scroll, below Jeffrey Epstien and several other less impactful stories."
Democrats are the problem,Guess the liberals are not happy about Iowa turning Red!
Democrats are the problem,"He identified as LGBTQ on his social media accounts, which disappointed progressives, so this incident will soon be forgotten. "
Democrats are the problem,If you truly want to lower gun violence take the guns away from Democrats.
Democrats are the problem,You are so vapid just regurgitating lib rhetoric.  
Gun control laws don't work,"Exactly. No ""quick easy fix"". No ""one and done"" by passing yet another gun law, or posting more ""gun free zone"" signs. Those are easy virtue signaling measures, but will do nothing. Fixing a morally bankrupt society is a bit more complicated than that though isn't it?"
Gun control laws don't work,"So, despite what you might know, there is nowhere in the US you can buy a gun without a background check. It's federal law. Maybe there are some loopholes, but if you have a record it's going to be known when your paperwork is being done. Additionally, if you buy two or more firearms at once, the ATF is going to get a form with your info. At this point, they may monitor your social media if they can find it. Not 100% on that and I don't really care what their policy is. There aren't enough 'local authorities' to actually keep up with that monitoring. Red flag laws supposedly work where they are in place, but it's a system that can be abused very easily and there are questions about violation of privacy, and unlawful search/seizures."
Gun control laws don't work,"Those “ No Firearms Allowed” signs work like a charm with those bad guys, don’t they?"
Gun control laws don't work,"Wow, I'm sure glad that guns aren't allowed in schools!"
It's a societal decline problem,"Agreed.  It's all about ""self"" nowadays.  There is no thought of sacrificing ANYTHING for others.  The country is doomed."
It's a societal decline problem,and public schools don't teach abstinence anymore.
It's a societal decline problem,And those same guns in those rifle racks stayed right there. No one messed with another person’s guns and those guns didn’t jump out of the pickup and harm anyone. It ain’t the guns people. 
It's a societal decline problem,"Having and owning a gun is a big responsibility, in fact, you have God's power when you wield a gun, because God has the power to take someone's life, and you as a gun owner have that power too, and as Spider-Man says, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"""
It's a societal decline problem,I learned gun safety in the Boy Scouts and earned a marksmanship merit badge in the 70's
It's a societal decline problem,I'm sorry your morals are so fickle.
It's a societal decline problem,"Lack of instilling accountability and values in kids, video games that make mass murder fun, and social media are all to blame. 50 years ago we carried pocket knives to school, rifles in pickup trucks, and rarely an incident like is common today. "
It's a societal decline problem,"Once the government got in the business of child rearing, it's all gone downhill. "
It's a societal decline problem,Society has changed. No morals anymore. 
It's a societal decline problem,"The bigger problem is that the government and mass media are devoted to breaking up traditional families. Outside pressures like that are the SOURCE of the mental illness in children. If the Powers that Be refuse to allow society to return to parenting and families, this problem will only get worse...."
It's a societal decline problem,"Yes, it's the morality. It's not the access to guns, because you used to be able to go into any hardware store and buy any gun with no background check at all. And yes, semi-autos existed, just like the ones they're absurdly trying to ban today. It's the morality that's gotten worse, not the guns."
Need stricter gun control,@esp the common denominator is that the gun manufacturers are the winners. they supply the guns that south/latin americans use as well.
Need stricter gun control,"And then add to the equation how easily accessible guns are, it's definitely a recipe for more mass shootings like this."
Need stricter gun control,"Conservative, liberal etc ... Iowans are, above all, decent people. I lived there 12 years and loved it. My best friend was an arch conservative Irish-catholic farmer who convinced me (a pacifist) we needed to hunt on his land to manage the deer population. If they can't sort this out we are lost. We need to get the adults in the room and take responsibility for our governance. Find a safer way forward. This is an unacceptable way to raise our kids."
Need stricter gun control,Do you even know why the founding fathers put in the Second Amendment?
Need stricter gun control,"I am beyond exhausted. This country’s firearms fetish is insane, and everyone in the world, except us, knows it."
Need stricter gun control,"Retired educator here. During my 34 years I saw schools go from being wide open to one door open to all doors locked to wearing ID’s to active shooter drills. In one of the last drills I did, I had my group of seniors, school leaders in a special program. As I looked at these great kids, and I saw them doing exactly what I said, I realized this is their life. It makes me sad to think about it. And to realize, for what seems like the millionth time, that guns are more valued than human lives."
Need stricter gun control,"That when someone purchases a lot of firearms and ammo, why can't that someone be on the radar of the local authorities?"
Need stricter gun control,This already happens. Multiple gun purchases trigger extra scrutiny.
Parents are the problem,"everything comes down to proper, loving and responsible parenting in every home in this country!rural/urban, rich/poor, black/white/yellow/ brown, straight/gay, married/seperated/ divorced. this has been the rule forever but it appears that the last two American generations have lost/forgotten/disregarded this universal fundamental truth."
Parents are the problem,hope they charge the parents too!!!
Protect gun rights,Explain how the gun caused the shooting.
Protect gun rights,Restricting my constitutional rights will not prevent these crimes.
Protect gun rights,"The government keeping and making lists and raiding homes because of ""excessive"" purchase is the very definition of ""infringed"""
Protect gun rights,"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
Protect gun rights,The shooter would have gotten a gun somehow or used another weapon if none available.
Protect gun rights,Your claim the gun caused the shooting is nonsensical.
Protect schools,"At this point, knowing all that we do, and the money made available for years, it's a deliberate act of ignorance and child endangerment not to secure the schools and train armed teachers. 1000% preventable. But Liberal school administrators want to create victims to support the Democrat anti gun a...See more"
Protect schools,"How is it possible, in todays day and age, that an armed police officer and metal detector is not stationed at each front entrance to every school in this country. "
Protect schools,it's so sad that kids have to grow up this way inside of school.
Republicans are the problem,@Janet: And mental health issues are being funded the way they should be. It's easier for the GOP to talk than to act.
Republicans are the problem,Another day of thoughts and prayers. Will prayers ever be answered?
Republicans are the problem,Great point! You notice this administration NEVER speaks of that violence!
Republicans are the problem,"Sadly, this is as common in America as a Trump lie."
The state spends too much,So what is the solution? Universal health care so kids get proper mental health supports?
The state spends too much,The government can monitor your social media accounts already - limited to what you make public.
The state spends too much,"You forgot about the 87,000 new IRS agents."
This is a rare event,Stop dreading a highly unlikely event and start spending those $$$ that he’s 3x more likely to win.
This is a rare event,There are 10’s of thousands of schools in America. The chances of being in a school shootings are probably near the same rate as being attacked by a polar bear
This is a rare event,"We suffer thousands of highway deaths in order to continue the convenience of driving, by which we get to work and to hospitals."
This is a tragedy,"@Daddy Frank Yup. We watch from afar, in horror."
This is a tragedy,Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims.
This is a tragedy,"The most powerful military in the history of mankind. Over 150 police officers responded to the call. Yet we are a country that cannot send our kids to school safely. You cannot tell me that there ta single parent in this country, on either side of the aisle, who can place hand on heart and say they do not worry about their kid going to school. What a shame!"
This is a tragedy,We have become so inured to the violence that this tragedy is not even a headline any more. Just another day at the office. Soon back-to-school shopping will include child-sized bullet-proof vests.
This is because of mental health,@Juliet. Because this kid finally snapped. That’s what “made him do this.”
This is because of mental health,An adult is suicidal & shoots himself on school property? Yup! You guessed it!
This is because of mental health,"Forget the idea that school shooters are Dems or Repubs, or that Trump or Biden are responsible. That narrative completely misses the mark. School shootings, as well as all mass shootings, are the result of mental illness. Political ideology may be the excuse used to justify such actions, but it is..."
This is because of mental health,It’s a mental illness crisis that you want to just paint over with rainbows and unicorns.  
This is because of mental health,"Not in all, but in many cases - from Charles Whitman to Columbine to this tragedy - these mass killings are followed by the suicide of the shooter. I looked up gun death statistics for 2021 and found that over half (54%) of all gun deaths are in fact suicides. Seems to indicate that a sense of personal failure, frustration and anti-social behavior are early signs that should disallow possession of firearms."
This is because of mental health,"Psychpaths will kill no matter what if it's in their twisted mind to do so. And they will use whatever means necessary, like knives, bombs, or gasoline. Where do you start with ""notifying the police""? More importantly, where do you stop? It's not a Second Amendment issue."
This is because of mental health,"Sad that we have people who are mentally unstable to this degree and being ignored by those who could keep these things from happening, in must instances. It’s not guns but person using that’s the problem. "
This is because of mental health,"When nut cases like this shooter rundown pedestrians at a parade, do you claim it's because people "
This is because of social media,"I think the internet has played a huge part of this also. Social media, fast exchange of information, glory hounds looking for fame, copy cats.."
This is because of social media,"If you trace the uptick in mass shootings, it correlates with the increased use of social media.  The two are inexorably linked.  "
This is because of social media,"When are we going to start addressing the mental health issues these kids suffer at the abuse of social media?  Snapchat, TicToc, Instagram etc.  Bullying at school is one thing, but no longer can they go home and be away from it.  These programs allow relentless bullying.  Aside from all the other..."
This is because of trans/woke ideology,And you refuse to admit transgender people have mental health issues.  How many trans shooters do there have to be before you blame their mental illness and not an inanimate object.
This is because of trans/woke ideology,Maybe you should find out a little more about the person who did this.  It won't fit your narrative.
This is because of trans/woke ideology,Shooter is a LGBTQ activist. Social media accounts are already scrubbed.
This is because of trans/woke ideology,The shooter identified as non-binary.  It's not a gun problem.  We all know that.
Other - policy discussion,"And of course, the government can't quarter troops in your home during peacetime."
Other - policy discussion,"Big business writing legislation is the problem; if you do not agree with that, then you should read the Constitution."
Other - policy discussion,"Gee, if only our government didn’t send foreign countries BILLIONS of our dollars. "
Other - policy discussion,If you all agree it’s a mental health issue why don’t you make mental health easily accessible?
Other - policy discussion,"Now, why can't that apply to guns as well,"
Other - policy discussion,"This is a multi factorial problem, and blaming the guns is a simplistic ""solution"". And makes little sense, as passing more laws will not solve it - criminals by definition disobey laws. I mean, murder is against the law, but these shooters ignore that one..."
Other - policy discussion,This is an extremely important article and it needs to be the headline for the paper until someone in government acts to stop children from dying at school.
Other - policy discussion,"To make sense of all the shootings that are traced back to ""bullying,"" we need to understand the details. Bullied for what kinds of things? What were the parents doing about it? What conditions in the home may have led to a student being bullied - lack of hygiene, parental abuse that leads kids to have low self-esteem and become a target to peers, isolation? On the other hand, many kids who bully have long histories of disruptive behavior which are often rooted in chaotic lives and mental health challenges. Seems to me that as a society our focus must be on making the home life safe for children. I fear that for millions of them, it is not."
